## To Run

The instructions to run the app assume you have a working Node environment installed. I recommend `v8.11.2`

To run the app either run:

`npm install && npm start`

or if you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed

`yarn && yarn start`

The app will then be started on port `8080` so please navigate to `localhost:8080` to view the app
